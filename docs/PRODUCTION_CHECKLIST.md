- [x] Docker build verification
- [x] Auto-deploy workflow (Fly.io/Render)

## üìö Documentation

- [x] Trimmed README with quick start

- [x] Development CORS: includes localhost variants
- [x] Mobile app uses env-driven API_BASE_URL
- [x] No hardcoded deployment URLs in code

## üê≥ Docker

- [x] Healthcheck in docker-compose (curl /health/ready)
- [x] Worker service in docker-compose
- [x] Migrations run via entrypoint.sh
- [x] Non-root user (nestjs:nodejs)
- [x] Multi-stage build
- [x] .dockerignore

## üìä Deployment Architecture

- [x] Frontend ‚Üí Vercel
- [x] Backend API + Worker ‚Üí Fly.io (primary) or Render (alternative)
- [x] Database ‚Üí Supabase PostgreSQL
- [x] Redis ‚Üí Upstash or Fly Redis
- [x] POS Connector ‚Üí Separate service (Phase 2)

## ‚úÖ Self-Test Commands

```bash
# Environment validation
npm run check:env
# ‚úÖ Should pass with real vars

# Health checks
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:3000/health/ready
# ‚úÖ Both should return 200

# GraphQL playground (dev only)
# Visit http://localhost:3000/graphql
# ‚úÖ Should NOT work in production

# Stripe webhook timing
# Send test webhook, measure response time
# ‚úÖ Should respond < 100ms

# Tests with coverage
npm run test:cov
# ‚úÖ Should pass 70% threshold
```

## üéâ All 12 Requirements Completed

1. ‚úÖ Tightened TypeScript (noImplicitAny, strictBindCallApply, noUncheckedIndexedAccess)
2. ‚úÖ Security middleware (helmet, CORS locked, rate limiting on /auth/*)
3. ‚úÖ Stripe webhook hardening (raw body, idempotency, <100ms response)
4. ‚úÖ GraphQL opt-in (ENABLE_GRAPHQL) and hardened (depth limit, playground off in prod)
5. ‚úÖ Logging (JSON in prod, requestId, userId) and Sentry
6. ‚úÖ Frontend integration (env-driven, no hardcoded URLs)
7. ‚úÖ POS contracts (JSON schemas + AJV tests)
8. ‚úÖ CI + coverage (GitHub Actions, 70% floor, prisma validate)
